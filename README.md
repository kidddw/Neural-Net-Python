# Neural-Net-Python
Neural Net solver in Python:
Uses backpropagation and conjugate gradient optimization in order to solve for the weights of a neural net. 
Requires 3 files to be present:
  training_x.dat: the data for x values
  training_y.dat: the data for corresponding y values
  arch.dat: the amount of units per hidden layer (each line represents a new layer)
Weights are output as weights.dat

Data example is taken from Coursera Machine Learning course
